Final Project To Do List

1. Description of my Code Louisville FSJS web app final project: It will be an interactive FSJS Course Syllabus To-Do List. It will tract where you are at in your syllabus, show you which week you should be on, and have checkboxes for each Treehouse Course section to mark complete. It will have buttons to add your weekly code challenges. Finally, it will have a page to track the progress of your final project for the course.
2. Requirements: Download/install NodeJs: https://nodejs.org/en/, Download/install Mongodb: https://www.mongodb.com/.
3. Steps needed to run and view: Currently website can be viewed: final-project-fsjs/app/home-nav-page, then right click and open index.html using "Open with" Chrome, Firefox, etc or double clicking on file. The app needs you to open command prompt and open file directory:final-project-fsjs/app/todo-app. Then install the following: npm install mongod --save, npm install express --save, npm install angualr --save, npm install body-parser --save, npm install mongoose --save, npm install nodemon --save, npm install webpack --save -dev. After the following packages, open a second command prompt both open to the file directory: final-project-fsjs/app/todo-app. One command prompt run: webpack --watch. Second command prompt run: nodemon. You also need to run mongod, but I have it always running in the background on my computer: third command prompt run: mongod.
